They Perched on Their Stilts, Pointing and Daring Me to Break Custom Lyrics
[Verse 1]

On my face, I scratched out something like a silhouette


Around the golden ten like lambs


On my face, I've hidden away any embarrassment
Away from my acquaintances


I'm not sold on anything but half a dream


I'm not sensing a thing


[Chorus]

I stare at a blank notebook page
And it's my life, and there is
Nothing I can think to write
I fear the thought of not sensing a thing


[Verse 2]

I hope you don't see a thing
Smile through everyone you ever meet

So what? You gave him the time of day

Twist back and end this suffering
Au naturel, I honestly give up and de-robe


[Chorus]
I stare at a blank notebook page
And it's my life, and there is
Nothing I can think to write
I fear the thought of not sensing a thing


[Outro]
Right side falls
Heavenly grace to you, I owe you too
Right side because
Heaven and I should be so easy
Right side falls
Heavenly grace to you, I owe you too, I owe you too
Right side because
Heaven and I should be so easy
Right side...
