Maggies and Vossy Lyrics
[Intro: VIRTUO]
Yeah, Look

[Chorus: VIRTUO]
I got the Maggies and Vossy
You better watch me
Cause I've been a little dangerous since she lost me
Come through with the gang with the posy
Me and you we can hang can't cross me
Watch me, better watch me
Watch me, better watch me
I got the Maggies and Vossy
Girl you better watch me

[Verse 1: VIRTUO]
Girl I've cleared my schedule and I've handled my affairs
I've got no errands and very littlе cares
Two two drinks because thе pocket comes in pairs
And when a nigga got it
You know a nigga shares
I got, vibes on deck no time to text
You can hide your head but the hands find the neck
See your old man he did the minor flex
Come with me and get the finer sex like
Fiver for the bossman tell him bring another potion
More fish in the sea but theres sharks up in this ocean
Riding the waves till the hips are showing motion
You better watch me cause I'm causing some commotion
I've been looking for trouble but never devotion
Let's just get in a bubble and sever emotion
Beach settings gotta get her the lotion
No pressure for the night we're just keeping it open


[PreChorus: VIRTUO]
Know you like to smoke but I ran with the Liquor
Atmosphere mad when you make plans with a nigga
See babe I got a hand for your figure
Boys can always flirt but takes a man to deliver
I know you like to smoke but I ran with the Liquor
Atmosphere mad when you make plans with a nigga
Yo babe I got a hand for your figure
Boys can always flirt but takes a man to deliver

[Chorus: VIRTUO]
I got the Maggies and Vossy
You better watch me
Cause I've been a little dangerous since she lost me
Come through with the gang with the posy
Me and you we can hang can't cross me
Watch me, better watch me
Watch me, better watch me
I got the Maggies and Vossy
Girl you better watch me

[Bridge: VIRTUO]
I'm not sure if she wants to Netflix and chill or just chill and watch Netflix
But she came round for dinner
And she stayed for some breakfast
Now she riding rodeo like she came from Texas
Now she riding me like I'm one of her exes


[Verse 2: Nerfboi]
Yeah, ring to me on the facetime
One Maggie to the face now I'm fucking on ya waistline
Busy girl, she don't waist time
Rack it up, she don't waist lines
Yeah yeah
Fuck it up
Vossy in the cup
That's the name of the potion
Maggie double up
Get me waved like the ocean
She gon' give it up
And I ain't even boasting
I'm just coasting, do it again
Fuck it up
Vossy in the cup
She-moves like the waves in the ocean
Maggie double up
She-moves like the waves in the ocean
She gon' give it up
She-moves like the waves in the ocean

[Outro:]
Ladies and gentlemen it was a coldblooded premeditated murder
Ha ha ha ha, will you bring me a drink please
