Ay Caramba Lyrics
[Intro]

S-S-Stay Flee Get Lizzy
S-S-Stay Flee Get Lizzy
S-S-Stay Flee Get Lizzy


Toddla T produc-y


[Chorus: Young T & Bugsey]

Ay, caramba
, body good, body proper
Let me blow all my wonga, all I want is a one dance
Let's tango, baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango, baby, pretty lady
Let's tango baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango baby, pretty lady

[Verse 1: Fredo]
My top's Lizzy, don't even touch me
Rap 'bout the streets so them young niggas love me
These Valentinos cost the same as my pumpy
Call me Selfridges, the west gyal love me
Top's from a robbery, shoes are from cunch fiends
So these feds hate the life that I live

We are talkin' about Z's, I put five on the strip

But, I'm missin' my sales when she's whinin' them hips

Today, it's Gucci designin' my kicks
Its funny 'cause double G's the size of her tits

Yeah, I just caught Mercedes all likin' my pics
And it's funny 'cause Mercedes designs all my whips
The sun's out, my gun's out, babe, come to the fun house
I need ten thousand to come to the club now
I think that she likes me, she wants to be wifey
Nice and she spicy, reminds me of Chinese


[Chorus: Young T & Bugsey]

Ay, caramba
, body good, body proper
Let me blow all my wonga, all I want is a one dance
Let's tango, baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango, baby, pretty lady
Let's tango baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango baby, pretty lady

[Verse 2: Fredo]
Ay, caramba
Gettin' money off of my Lyca number
Give my yungens food, then they will likely bump ya'
Tits sit right and I'll like the bumper
Give gyal my phone they write the number
Sittin' in jail, so I write my younger
Got three years, he'll do slightly under
But he can't keep havin' fights in jummah
In the club, I ain't into whinin' and dancin'
Them man there are dabbin', 
my diamonds are dancin'

You know, I'm Fred', babe, so, why are you askin'?
I'm lean like them shoes you buy in the market
I'm shoppin' in up town, so, tell them to come 'round

I've got so much yak in this yard, it won't run out


I don't run for the bus now, I'm bust down


Babe, I don't want your love 'cause I love pounds



[Chorus: Young T & Bugsey]

Ay, caramba
, body good, body proper
Let me blow all my wonga, all I want is a one dance
Let's tango, baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango, baby, pretty lady
Let's tango baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango baby, pretty lady

Ay, caramba
, body good, body proper
Let me blow all my wonga, all I want is a one dance
Let's tango, baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango, baby, pretty lady
Let's tango baby, whine your waist for me
Let's tango baby, pretty lady
