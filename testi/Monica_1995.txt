Monica (Demo) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm very emotional, don't you know?
I'm so fragile, but I'm full of integrity
I'm very controlling, I need control
I can let go, but I don't out of necessity
I met you through a friend and you should know
My intentions were good, but our chemistry was not that good
We are very hypothetical people
I think you catch my drift, but if not

[Chorus]
Oh, 
Monica

I'm not the one for ya
I'm not the one for ya
But I hope you find them soon
Oh, Monica
I am not the one for ya (You)
I'm not the one for ya
But I hope you find them soon

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I will not lead you on (I)
I-I-I-I will not lead you on

[Verse 2]
I picked you up on a Friday night
I was on time as usual, I don't mess around
I drove us up to the carnival
Popcorn, candy, my favorite
Would you like to dance with mе?
We had a lot of fun
But I know you're looking for someonе
That one, your one and only


[Pre-Chorus]
I will not let you down slowly
I will not lead you on

[Chorus]
Oh, Monica
I'm not the one for ya
I'm not the one for ya
But I hope you find them soon
Oh, Monica
I am not the one for ya (You)
I'm not the one for ya
But I hope you find them soon

[Post-Chorus]
I-I-I (I-I-I) will not lead you on (I)
I-I-I-I will not lead you on (On)
I-I-I (I-I-I) will not lead you on (I)
I-I-I-I will not lead you on

[Bridge]
Too many people wasting too much time
Too many people keeping things inside their mind
Too many people wasting too much time
Too many people keeping things inside their mind


[Chorus]
Oh, Monica (Monica)
I'm not the one for ya
I'm not the one for ya
But I hope you find them soon
Oh, Monica
I am not the one for ya (You)
I'm not the one for ya (Monica)
But I hope you find them soon

[Outro]
I-I-I will not lead you on (I)
(I, I, I, I, you, you, you, you)
I-I-I-I will not lead you on (On)
(I, I, I, I, you, you, you, you)
I-I-I will not lead you on (I)
(I, I, I, I, you, you, you, you)
I-I-I-I will not lead you on
(I, I, I, I, you, you, you, you)
