I'll give you whatcha want just holla’
Every boy goes to Rome
But no need to botha’
But-but no need to botha’
Cause I got what they got, but hotta
Come on boy, step in closa’
Hey I think I like ya
Hey-hey I think I like ya
(Paaaaaarty!), hey, hey I think I like ya!
(Paaaaaarty!), hey, hey I think I like ya!
(Paaaaaarty!), hey, hey I think I like ya!
(Paaaaaarty!):
Lookin' hot, all done up
Party till the break of dawn
Move in groups, leave in twos
We got swagger
Lookin' hot, all done up
Dancing ‘till the sun comes up
Disco romancing
Disco romancing
Just relax, let me say holla’
Take a chance, get out of orda’
Tonight is all we've got (got)
Tonight is all we've…
I'll give you whatcha need just say so
Every boy says: "Ti amo!"
Cause I know where to go, where to go, go!
