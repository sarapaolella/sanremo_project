[Verse 1: Bridgers]
She's asleep in the back seat
Looking peaceful enough to me

But she's wakin' up inside a dream
Full of screeching tires and fire

We're comin' back from where no one lives
Pretty much just veterans

When I pointed out where the North Star is


She called me a fuckin' liar


[Chorus: Bridgers, 
Dacus & Baker

Emily, I'm sorry, I just (
Emily, I
)


Make it up
 
as I go along


And I can feel myself becoming (
I can feel
)

Someone
 
only you could want


[Verse 2: Bridgers]

Headed straight for the concrete
In a nightmare, screaming


Now I'm wide awake, spiraling
And you don't wanna talk


Just take me back to Montreal


I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school


We can burn out in the freezing cold

And just get lost


[Chorus: Bridgers, 
Dacus & Baker

Emily, I'm sorry, baby (
Emily, I
)

You know how I get when I'm wrong (
You know how I get
)

And I can feel myself becoming (
I can feel
)
Somebody 
I'm not, I'm not, so


Emily, forgive me, can we (
Emily, I
)


Make
 it 
up as we go along?


I'm twenty-seven and I don't know who I am (
Don't know who I am
)


But I know what I want


[Outro: Bridgers]

Emily, I'm sorry
Emily, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
