[Verse 1: Al Bano]
Happiness
Means holding hands and go far away, happiness
Is your innocent look in the middle of the people, happiness
Means staying together like children, happiness
Happiness

[Verse 2: Romina Power]
Happiness
Is a feather pillow, the river's water that flows
Is the rain going down the roofs, happiness
Is turning off the light to make peace, happiness
Happiness

[Verse 3: Al Bano]
Happines
Is a glass of wine and a sandwich, happiness
Is leaving you a note inside the drawer, happiness
Is singing togethеr how much I like you, happiness
Happiness

[Chorus: Al Bano & Romina Power]
Feel it, in thе air there's already
Our love song that flies
Just like a thought that knows about happiness
Feel it, in the air there's already
A warm ray of sun that goes
Just like a smile that knows about happiness

[Verse 4: Romina Power]
Happiness
Is a surprising night, with the light turned on and the radio that's playing
It's a happy birthday card full of hearts, happiness
Is an unexpected phone call, happiness
Happiness

[Verse 5: Al Bano]
Happiness
Is a beach at night with the waves that hit the shore, happiness
Is a hand on a heart full of love, happiness
Is waiting for the sunrise to do it again, happiness
Happiness

[Chorus: Al Bano & Romina Power]
Feel it, in the air there's already
Our love song that flies
Just like a thought that knows about happiness
Feel it, in the air there's already
A warm ray of sun that goes
Just like a smile that knows about happiness
Feel it, in the air there's already
Our love song that flies
Just like a thought that knows about happiness
