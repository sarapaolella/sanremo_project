Hey! It's a clear night!
Can you feel the starlight and it's magical action on your brain?
Come on! Come on! you gotta let it begin
You gotta let your life win
You got, you got nothing more to lose!
Come on! Come on! You're gonna die one day
You don't know where or when; there are no survivors!
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Won't you join in the celebration!
Hey! Come on! Come on! Won't you join in the celebration!

Come on! Come on! Bring your broken heart!
Bring your life that's torn apart
Ain't you bored with the fighting and the blame?
Come on! Come on! Let your tears fall!
They're just a love call, let 'em, let 'em mingle with the rain!
Come on! Come on! If you feel like no-one
It don't care for names, it's a hungry flame!
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Won't you join in the celebration!
Hey! Come on! Come on! Won't you join in the celebration!

See the fire upon the hill! It's your life, it's burning still
Can you hear the call of the wild wind?
Come on! Come on! Do you wanna be the one
Who can laugh and sing in the sun
Or do you wanna be the one who holds the gun?
Come on! Come on! You're gonna die one day
You don't know where or when; there are no survivors!
Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! Won't you join in the celebration!
